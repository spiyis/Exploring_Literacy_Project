            <b><font size = "+2" font color = "#365859"><br>Project Mission:</font></b><br><br> In an effort to examine literacy and reading preferences in the age of social media, this project examines
            two datasets, global literacy rates and Goodreads book ratings. I do not aim to determine why literacy rates around the world are
            the way they are, but rather examine the "pipeline" of reading, from literacy all the way to reading preferences. My more humanistic goal is to explore why someone loves a book
            they read! 

            <br><br><br><br>
            <b><font size = "+1" font color = "#365859">I examine literacy under two lenses: geographic region and gender. The two questions I aim to answer are:</font></b> <br><br>
            1. How does literacy rates by gender vary country to country and state to state in the United States? Is there a connection between 
            total literacy and literacy among male and female populations in the countries with the lowest literacy rates?
            <br><br>
            2. Do literacy rates tend to improve as time goes on?
            <br><br><br>
            <b><font size = "+1" font color = "#365859">Using varous attributes of books and their Goodreads' ratings, I aim to answer:</font></b>
            <br><br>
            1. Is there a specific genre that people tend to rate higher and thus enjoy more?
            <br><br>
            2. What kinds of books are people rating on Goodreads? Are there trends in genre, publication year, etc.?
            <br><br>
            3. Do more awards or the language of the book correlate to a higher average rating?
            <br><br>
            4. Are there trends in the average ratings of books based on its genre or number of awards?<br>

            Goodreads user demographics provide the framework for my analysis of both literacy and Goodreads ratings. The largest two age groups of Goodreads users are 18-24 and 25-34 year olds. Thus, I chose to further examine literacy for people aged 15+. As shown, the majority of Goodreads users are from the United States,
            but there are citizens of many other countries using Goodreads. Therefore, I did not wish to limit my analysis to only the United States and English books. 
            Rather, I look at world-wide literacy and books from other languages, in addition to literacy within the United States. <br><br><br> Moreover <b>61.07%</b> of Goodreads users are female, so I chose to examine literacy under the lens of gender. <br><br>

        <b><font size = "+1">Literacy Rates: </font></b> The data used for world literacy was found on Kaggle, and required little cleaning, 
            which was done all in Python. The dimensions of data included for each country was female literacy rate, male literacy rate, and 
            total population literacy rate for the years 2010-2018 (not every country had data for each year). Moreover, the same dimensions 
            were available per age group within the country's population: 15+, 15-24, 25-64, and 65+.

            This dataset did not include any data on United States literacy, however. While searching for information on the United States, 
            I found little useable data, especially for the years 2010-2018. Therefore, I needed to compile my data from an alternative source 
            and create my own database. I found 2023 United States literacy rates per state on "wisevoter," which is a website aimed at providing 
            up-to-date data regarding United States policy concerns. I have provided the website below: <br><br>
            <a href="https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/literacy-rate-by-state/ ">Wisevoter: U.S. Literacy</a>
            <br><br><hr>
        <b><font size = "+1">Goodreads: </font></b> This Kaggle dataset was comprehensive, including information on over 50,000 books and their ratings scraped from Goodreads. 
            It includes primarily English books, but also some from various other languages. The dimensions of data for each book are extensive, but the ones most relevant to 
            my analysis are numerical rating, genre, year of publication, language, and awards. The data, however, had to be cleaned significantly to remove measurement formatting 
            errors and thus make it usable for analysis. I used Microsoft Excel and Python to do so. Additionally, I created two new columns, one that measured the number of awards 
            and another that separated the primary genre from a list of all genres. 
            <br><br> The Goodreads user demographic information was found on two sources that I have linked below: <br><br>
            <b> Age Demographics: </b><a href = "https://www.similarweb.com/website/goodreads.com/#interests ">Data</a><br>
